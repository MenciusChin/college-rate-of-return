In the following context we will provide visualizations for
aspects of the markets and give the audience a sense of how to choose a industry of interest and target several companies.</p><h2 id="part-1:-market-health-overview">Part <!-- -->1<!-- -->: Market Health Overview</h2></div><div class="idyll-scroll" id="idyll-scroll-0" style="position:relative"><div class="idyll-scroll-graphic" style="top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:auto;width:100%;transform:translate3d(0, 0, 0);z-index:-1;height:0"><div style="width:0;position:absolute;left:0;right:0;top:50%;transform:translateY(-50%)"><div><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/412demo/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="600"></iframe></div></div></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><div class="idyll-scroll-text"><div class="idyll-step "><p>
       To create this scrolling segment of the document, we first specify a <code>Scroller</code> component, which can just be done with <code>[Scroller] ... [/Scroller]</code>. The text and visualizations seen here are specified within this component.

       The background is that same Tableau map visualization from earlier, but displayed at a larger size.
     </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
       To set the background, you can use a <code>Graphic</code> component to wrap the <code>TableauEmbed</code> component from earlier.
     </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
       The contents for these text boxes are described with the <code>Step</code> component, and can even include other components like the visualizations from before!</p><div></div></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
       Take a look in the <code>index.idyll</code> file to see exactly how this works in the code, and keep scrolling for more examples.
